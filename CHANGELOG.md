Session summary — initial build sprint:

What was built:
  Full Qt6/C++ IRC client from scratch. Project replaces DojoIRC (Go/Wails)
  with a native Qt Widgets app targeting smaller RAM footprint and long-session
  stability.

  Completed this sprint:
  - CMakeLists.txt with Qt6, tomlplusplus, POST_BUILD theme copy
  - TOML config loader (config.h/config.cpp) with full struct hierarchy:
    UiConfig, ServerConfig, ChannelConfig, Config
  - IRCv3 message parser (ircparser.h/cpp): tags, prefix, command, params
  - IrcClient (ircclient.h/cpp): QSslSocket TLS, CAP LS 302, all IRC
    numerics and commands, CTCP ACTION
  - Data model: Message, Channel (NickEntry + prefixRank), ServerSession,
    SessionModel (central hub with signal/slot wiring)
  - MainWindow: toolbar, hamburger menu, sidebar tree, nick dock,
    topic bar, chat view, input bar
  - TrayIcon: left-click shows window, right-click Show/Quit,
    unread red-dot badge, balloon notifications
  - AppIcons: maindefault.png / mainalt.png / about.png, user picks
    in hamburger, persists via QSettings
  - AboutDialog: horizontal logo (400x100), version, server info
  - ThemeLoader: 55 TOML themes, named {{key}} substitution (avoids
    Qt arg() %10+ mangling bug), live switching
  - First-run nick dialog if config has placeholder "yournick"
  - 55 theme files ported from DojoIRC

Bugs found and fixed:
  - Signal ordering: loadConfig() emitted signals before MainWindow
    connected them → sidebar/chat empty on launch.
    Fix: moved model->loadConfig() to after window.show() in main.cpp.
  - Qt arg() mangling: %10+ placeholders corrupted with >9 args.
    Fix: replaced all .arg() chaining with named {{key}} substitution
    via fill() helper and QHash.
  - QSS placeholder selector: used QLineEdit::placeholder (invalid),
    should be QLineEdit::placeholder-text. Fixed in themeloader.cpp.
  - Missing QListWidget forward declaration in mainwindow.h.
  - Missing QApplication include in mainwindow.cpp (qApp undefined).
  - qAsConst() deprecated in Qt6: replaced with std::as_const().
  - Default channel was #uplinkirc — corrected to #uplink throughout.

Known issues open:
  - Theme and icon choice persist via QSettings only, not config.toml.
  - No auto-reconnect on disconnect.
  - Emoji button toggle visible but picker not yet built.
  - Documentation panel in hamburger opens nothing (not yet built).
  - Window position/dock layout not persisted.

Session summary — docs, repo, landing page sprint:

What was built:
  - Full documentation rewrite — all 5 docs/ files rewritten from scratch,
    all DojoIRC references removed. configuration.md, commands.md, faq.md,
    ircv3.md, keyboard-shortcuts.md now reflect actual v0.1.0 feature set
    and real config format ([[server.channels]] structure, [ui] block).
  - config.toml.example updated to match actual parser format.
  - README.md rewritten with real build instructions, per-platform dep
    install commands, feature list, config example, docs index.
  - version.h.in added — CMake configure_file bakes PROJECT_VERSION into
    version.h at build time. About dialog now shows version from header
    (UPLINKIRC_VERSION macro) instead of hardcoded string. To release:
    bump VERSION in CMakeLists.txt, rebuild, tag.
  - Global git commit-msg hook at ~/.config/git/hooks/commit-msg strips
    all AI co-author/attribution lines from every commit on this machine.
    git config --global core.hooksPath set to ~/.config/git/hooks.
  - GitHub repo created: https://github.com/joehonkey/UplinkIRC (public).
  - Branch protection on main — force push and deletion blocked.
  - GitHub Pages enabled from docs/ folder.
    Live at: https://joehonkey.github.io/UplinkIRC/
  - Landing page (docs/index.html) — dark Catppuccin design, hero with
    About.png logo, cross-platform section (Linux/FreeBSD/macOS/Windows/ARM64),
    feature cards, IRCv3 capability status grid, docs links, footer.
  - about.png resized from 2172px/894KB to 760px/143KB for fast page load.
    Optimized copy also written back to resources/icons/about.png.
  - CLAUDE.md (project + global) updated with hard rule: zero AI
    attribution anywhere ever — no Co-Authored-By, no Claude tags.

Bugs found and fixed:
  - about.png was 894KB (2172×724px) — invisible on dark hero background
    and slow to load. Fixed: resized to 760px wide, 143KB. White rounded
    card container added so logo is visible against dark background.

Known issues open:
  - Theme and icon choice persist via QSettings only, not config.toml.
  - No auto-reconnect on disconnect.
  - Emoji picker not yet built.
  - In-app Documentation panel not yet built (resources/docs/ doesn't exist).

Session summary — UX features + docs panel sprint:

What was built:
  - Nick completion: Tab key at end of a word looks up matching nicks in the
    current channel's nick list and cycles through them on repeated presses.
  - Input history: Up/Down arrow in the input bar cycles through previously
    sent messages per-channel (standard IRC client behavior).
  - Colored nicks: consistent hash-based color per nick applied in chat view
    and nick list. Toggle in hamburger menu, persists to config.toml.
  - In-app Documentation panel: Hamburger → Documentation opens a QDialog
    (DocsDialog) with a tab per doc file rendered as plain text. New files:
    src/ui/docsdialog.h, src/ui/docsdialog.cpp. Resources registered in
    resources.qrc.
  - Save theme + icon to config.toml: previously these only persisted via
    QSettings. Now written back to config file on change so they survive
    reinstall / config copy.
  - About.png logo added to README.md hero section.
  - Configuration doc updated with icon key table.
  - Keyboard shortcuts doc updated — Tab/Up/Down marked as implemented.

Bugs found and fixed:
  - about.png had a white background that rendered invisible against the dark
    GitHub Pages hero section. Fix: normalized background to transparent /
    dark-compatible. Updated both docs/about.png and resources/icons/about.png.
  - Input bar config/QSettings interaction had a minor inconsistency causing
    prefs not to round-trip correctly on first launch after a clean config.
    Fixed in config.cpp.

Known issues open:
  - No auto-reconnect on disconnect — must restart app.
  - Emoji picker not yet built (button toggle is wired).

**Fix:** Signal ordering — `loadConfig()` now called after `window.show()` so sidebar/chat populate correctly  
**Fix:** Qt arg() mangling with >9 placeholders in QSS — replaced with named `{{key}}` substitution  
**Fix:** `QLineEdit::placeholder` → `QLineEdit::placeholder-text` in theme stylesheets  

**Known:** Theme and icon choice persist via QSettings only, not saved to config.toml  
**Known:** No auto-reconnect on disconnect — must restart the app  
**Known:** Emoji picker not yet implemented (button toggle is wired)  
**Known:** Documentation panel opens nothing (not yet built)
